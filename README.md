# This repository is a collection for all the VHDL projects I wrote whilst at the University of Sheffield. It does not contain updated or actively worked on code.

Some of the projects may include the use of other Xilinx IPs, which I do not own. Any code written by myself is solely avaliable for individual, non-commercial use, and may remain the intellectual property of The University of Sheffield.
